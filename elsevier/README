I did my best to follow both the guidelines for latex publications in
the latex class file and the guidelines described in the submission
process.  

The biggest problem I had was regarding figures, since they are
typically combinations of images and tex file overlays for more
consistant fonts within the document.  I have left the original figure
definitions embedded in the latex file, but by default they are not
used, and I have instead included standalone pdfs for all figuures and
tables, as expected by the submission process.  In addition, I have
included captions in the document, but not on the figures themselves.

I hope this is acceptable, let me know if there is a better way to
format this document for submission.
