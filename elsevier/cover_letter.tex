  \opening{Editors:}

  Thank you for reviewing our paper \emph{Daily reference
    evapotranspiration for California using satellite imagery and
    weather station measurement interpolation}.  This paper describes
  an important research application for California water resources
  that we feel would have broad interest.

  I did my best to follow both the guidelines for LaTeX publications
  and the guidelines described in the submission process.

  The biggest problem I had was regarding figures, since they are
  typically combinations of images and tex file overlays for more
  consistant fonts within the document.  I have left the original
  figure definitions embedded in the LaTeX file, but by default they
  are not used, and I have instead included standalone pdfs for all
  figuures and tables, as expected by the submission process.  Also
  from the submission guidelines, I have included captions in the
  document, but not on the figures themselves.

  Let me know if there is a better way to format this document for
  submission.  Please contact me at qjhart@ucdavis.edu if you have any
  questions.

  \closing{Best,}
 \end{letter}
