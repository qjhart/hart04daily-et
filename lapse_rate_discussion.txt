Sometime around August, 2004 we redid the previous datasets with 
a new set of lapse rates for \ac{Tx},\ac{Tn}, and \ac{dewp}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

    Lapse rate estimates for temperature interpolations change for different 
daily temperatures under the assumption that the relative humidity, which 
decrease the lapse rate also changes throughout the day.

  \begin{tabular}{l|c}
    Temperature & Lapse Rate (\unitfrac{\ensuremath{^\circ}C}{km}) \\
    \hline \hline
    \acs{dewp} & 6 \\
    \acs{Tn} & 6.5 \\
    \acs{Tx} & 7.5
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:lapse}
\end{table}
 
This is how I came up with these values: I used the typically 
cited value of 6.5 C / km, for the Environmental Lapse Rate : 
(ELR), as a starting point.  But since that varies widely, I 
also took into account the Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate 
(SALR) ~ 6 C /km , and the DALR (10C/km).  I figured that at 
the Max AT, the humidity is lowerer, and air is moving more, 
so the lapse rate is somewhere between the ELR and DALR, 
which is why I choose 7.5C/km.  Then I used the SALR for the 
dew point temp.
 
Most examples I found from other sources, typically used the 
SALR, or assumed a moving mass of air and used the DALR up to 
dew point and SALR beyond that.  
 
I did find one example,
https://www.metocwx.quantico.usmc.mil/metoc_resource_center/qmmph1/Tmis/QMMPH1-019%20Lapse%20Rates.pdf,


However that said something different regarding dew point; 
"b. As a rule of thumb, the dew point decreases approximately 
2C per 1000 meters."  Although I have noted that still air 
lapse rates are less then the adiabatic,  I can't see why dew 
point would change so slowly.
